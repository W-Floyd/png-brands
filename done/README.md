# PNG Brands

I want to make some nice T-Shirts some day with these on them. Couldn't source the logos elsewhere in a vector format (if at all), so I recreated them here. In some cases, I have deviated ever so slightly, such as the Trukai logo, in which I mirrored the main pattern to save time, where the original logo is asymetric in some details.
